// chartBase.scss — CSS class definitions for SVG chart elements.
// These classes are applied to SVG elements in shared components (axes, legend)
// and are styled entirely through CSS custom properties injected by ChartThemeProvider.
//
// This file is the SCSS source of truth. The runtime equivalent lives in
// baseStyles.ts as a static string (to avoid requiring consumers to import CSS).
