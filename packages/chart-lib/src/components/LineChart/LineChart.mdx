# LineChart

An accessible multi-series line chart with optional smooth curves and data-point markers.

## Default (smooth)

A single series rendered with monotone-X curve interpolation.

<Canvas of={LineChartStories.Default} />

## Multiple series

Two series overlaid on the same axes, each with its own colour.

<Canvas of={LineChartStories.MultipleSeries} />

## Straight lines

Disable smooth curves for a linear interpolation between points.

<Canvas of={LineChartStories.StraightLines} />

## Small chart

Compact dimensions demonstrating responsive scaling.

## Props

## Architecture notes

- Uses `d3-scale` (`scaleLinear`) for both axes and `d3-shape` (`line` + `curveMonotoneX`) for path generation.
- Extents are computed across all series via `getLineExtent` from `utils/scales.ts`.
- Each data point is rendered as a `<circle>` with a `<title>` tooltip showing the `(x, y)` values.
- The `<svg>` element includes `role="img"`, `aria-label`, and a `<desc>` for accessibility.
